Brief Project Workflow :

The twitter heat-map project fetches real time tweets corresponding to the users interests and displays them on a map based on the coordinates specified in the tweets.All archived tweets are also fetched from the database upon user request.The project has been hosted on Amazon Web Services with the database residing in an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance and the server being in an Elastic Bean Stalk instance.Data transfer between the two instances takes place via web-sockets.   

This version of TweetMapper includes Amazons Simple Queueing Service(SQS) for processing tweets using Alchemy.api and uses Simple Notification Service(SNS) to publish messages to the client when processing is completed.
